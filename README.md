# rack-sorting-algorithm
Sorts source racks containing different numbers of samples (1-96) into destination racks, following these guideline: 1) No more than 20 racks (source + destination combined) in one batch. 2) Maximize the number of spots filled in destination racks. 3) Minimize the number of batches. Works best with rack data that has significantly more frequent source racks containing lower numbers of samples than higher numbers of samples.
